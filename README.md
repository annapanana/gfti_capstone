If you are using this site on a mobile device, you can take a photo and directly upload it to the site. Alternatively, you can upload a photo from your desktop or provide an image URL.

Step 3: Edit Design
You can use 5 different widgets to customize your design. Tools include image filters, border themes, color selection, font selection and subtext customization.
